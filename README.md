## About the Video Course
React Native is a JavaScript framework that lets you rapidly build native apps for both iOS and Android using a single language. A React native app is not a hybrid app so it's nearly indistinguishable from native apps built with Java and Objective-C. 

Our course is a fast-paced guide to get you started with React Native and building Native mobile apps. The course will give React developers all they need to build native iOS and Android apps. We won't be covering the basics of JavaScript programming or React. We will delve directly into React Native to build native mobile apps. You will learn to develop apps that are fun, unique, and responsive with React Native. Learn React Native fundamentals to build interactive and user-friendly apps. The course aims at teaching you React Native irrespective of the underlying platform so that you can learn once, write anywhere. 

This course adopts a practical approach to get you building apps as soon as possible. With this course, you will get minimal theory and maximal action, with compelling illustrative examples and clear explanations.
